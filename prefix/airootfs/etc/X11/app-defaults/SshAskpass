! X11 does a miserable job of providing resolution-independent drawing facilities---it expects everything to be done in pixels.  
! So if you happen to run your X server at a resolution of 100 pixels per inch (or some other strange value) instead of the widely used default of 75, 
! x11-ssh-askpass looks might tiny.  [Sigh].
! 
! To get around this, umm, limitation, we declare the resolution that the spacing and width/height pixels values are "valid" for, along with a fuzz factor.  
! If the current actual resolution is outside of the range of <DEFAULT - FUZZ>..<DEFAULT + FUZZ>, then we scale pixel measurements to fit the actual resolution.
! 
! (And if you think *this* is a horrid hack, then take a look at the actual code, which has to deal with conversion to [cheesy fanfare] that's right---millimeters!!!  
! The right hand managed to slip that one in while the left hand was adding a '-dpi' switch to the sample server implementation.  
! I think both left feet were adding the RESOLUTION_X and RESOLUTION_Y fields [in dots per inch, naturally] to the X Logical Font Description.  
! The irony is underwhelming.)
